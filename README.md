### Something I want to say to you 📦

I truly believe in a person's capability to break the limits and accomplish her dreams no matter how far-fetched it may sound. As long as you have strong faith in yourself, this entire universe will be on your side. A simple-yet-complicated, happy-go-lucky little girl like me has been wandering off many corners of the Earth with that principle and I hope it inspires you in some dimension. 

Good luck with your journey! If anything that can happen next, it's you and me who work on the same open source code project ^^
